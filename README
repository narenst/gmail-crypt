gmail-crypt is a plugin originally written by sean coyler. I'm trying to integrate social keys into this. 

i.e., after key generation the public key will be pushed to facebook as a note. This way when another user requires
the public key, it will be queried for from facebook and used.

This idea leverages the fact that users already trust the facebook identity of a person. hence the public key 
of a person on facebook is also trustworthy.

This is from this paper
